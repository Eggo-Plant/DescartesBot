# DescartesBot
A basic python discord bot

> This is my first python project, so it's likely held together with duct-tape and paper mache. Feel free to use the code however you like. You can also simply copy this bot and re-host it yourself if you want. Setup instructions are below.

**Setup Instructions**
- copy main.py
- create a file called .env
- put `TOKEN=YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE` as the first line, and save it.
- That's it! Just run main.py with any python verison 3.

I probably won't post an invite link publicly, it's just a personal project.
