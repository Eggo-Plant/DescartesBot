# DescartesBot
A basic python discord bot

> This is my first python project, so it's likely held together with duct-tape and paper mache. Feel free to use the code however you like. You can also simply copy this bot and re-host it yourself if you want. Setup instructions are below.

**Setup Instructions**
- Download `main.py` and `requirements.txt`
- create a file called `.env` in the folder where you placed them.
- put `TOKEN=YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE` as the first line, and save it.
- Install all the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- That's it! Just run main.py with any python verison >= 3.6

I probably won't post an invite link publicly, it's just a personal project.
